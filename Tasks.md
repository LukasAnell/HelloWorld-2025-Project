 - Implement a server with the llama model
 - look into whether we can send pdf or how to establish communication with the server
 - load balancing aka kick people into a queue if more than one tries to use the server at once
 - GUI
   - Button to select files
   - Step by step walkthrough and score evaluation of each part of the resume
   - Engineer the prompts (concrete prompts)
   - We should set up a rubric and ask the AI 
   to evaluate each category because I don't trust the AI to be objective
     - Is this a resume (yes or no)? if no why or how is this related to applying to jobs?
     - Conciseness score? longer than a page, does the text ramble, bullet points
     - Relevance? If you're applying to a robotics company then robotics experience should be at the top
     - Section by section analysis
     - prompt the user which company / club are you applying to / what do they do?
